3. Java Swing is a part of JFC (Java Foundation Classes) which is used to create window-based applications.
4. AWT (Abstract Windowing Toolkit) is the base for Java Swing.
5. Java Swing is used to build lightweight GUI applications.
6. Java Swing provides a lot of styling components such as buttons, labels, text fields, etc. for building the GUI.
7. JFrames are top-level containers provided by Java Swing which provide a playground for designing components.
8. JFrames are also known as base windows on which other components such as menu bars, panels, labels, text fields, buttons, etc. rely.
